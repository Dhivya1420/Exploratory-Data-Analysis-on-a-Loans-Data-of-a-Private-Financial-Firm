# Objectives:
**(1) Importing all the necessary modules. 
(2) Importing the data into python notebook. 
(3) Check the Variables names following the Naming Convention. 
(4) Check the information: Data type Conversions.
(5) Checking the relevant and irrelevant variables in the first phase of EDA.
(6) Data Duplicacy: ChecK if their is duplicate data or not: DDT ( Data Duplicacy Treatment).
(7) Missing Values Treatment.
(8) Separating the categorical Variables and Numerical variables into two different datasets for Data Preparations for Data Analysis. (9) Filling missing values in Numerical data with the Median values.
(10) Filling missing values in Categorical data with the Mode values.
(11) Outlier Treatment.**
